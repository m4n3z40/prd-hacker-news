I then added buildings from OpenStreetMap (crowd sourced) and more recently from Overture Maps data. Some computer vision&#x2F;machine learning advancements [1] in the past few years have made it possible to estimate tree canopy heights using satellite imagery alone making it possible to finally add trees to the map. The data isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s within +&#x2F;- 3 meters of so. Good enough to give a general idea for any location on Earth.

Although in theory it “works”, it does not create an entertaining experience as a game, although to me it is quite fun just too see it output ZIL for all of the rooms in a DOOM WAD, with all of the objects in all of their correct locations by their plain English names, along with the 8-character names for the textures of the walls, floors, and ceilings in their relative positions in the room. Part of that enjoyment of course comes from knowing what it entails just to get that far, so the amount of entertainment you derive from that may be far less. In fact, I suspect that for most people at this point the most amusing thing about Wadzilla will be the very concept of its existence - and of course the name, which I will take credit for while also acknowledging how fortuitous it is that the project practically named itself. “What should I name a tool that converts WAD to ZIL? Oh yeah, right. Of course. Wadzilla.”<p>I share it in this early stage because I suspect many in this audience may enjoy just reading about it, and many others might be excited by it and want to contribute to the effort, and also because I welcome feedback here and contributions by way of GitHub issues and PRs.",
