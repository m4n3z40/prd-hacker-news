I would propose that if we (all taxpayers) added 6 more lanes to the road you drive to work, your commute would dip for a short while, more people just like you would move to the new suburbs beyond yours, that are now an (improved for them) 1 hour commute, eventually re-saturating the new wider road. Now your commute is, best case, the same, maybe a little worse, because if it gets better, more people will squeeze into your suburb. You also have the option to move even farther out, but your commute will on average always be roughly as bad as it is today because people in your situation tolerate about that level of &#x27;misery.&#x27; (Again that&#x27;s how i conceptualize the variable, not saying you&#x27;re literally miserable).<p>Yes, I suppose stimulating another splash of suburbs out in the countryside does provide Y more people an opportunity to become long-distance commuters, but I&#x27;d say:<p>Surely there&#x27;s some limit, right?

And if there&#x27;s some limit to reasonable highway size, why not the current size. And if we want to further increase capacity to bring in humans to a city, build a bullet train and bring them in in a way that&#x27;s more efficient than individual 6,000 pound SUVs for each commuter.

Once enough ketones become available there is no more keto flu. From there most people feel at least normal, and many feel a bit better than normal because the cycles of both energy and satiety are smoothed out by the change in fuel sources.<p>&gt; And if ketones were that healthy then diabetics would the the healthiest people of all.<p>Diabetics have health complications precisely because they cannot moderate their blood glucose, with or without ketones. Ketones do not regulate blood glucose, insulin does. Unlike glucose, excess ketones are harmlessly urinated out, they do not need insulin to process them.<p>Glucose in the blood is toxic [1] if it isn&#x27;t metabolised because of lack of insulin, and even most diabetics consume enough carbohydrates for this to be a risk. There is a clear relationship between availability of insulin and safe levels of glucose consumption, in fact injecting insulin is usually the first intervention if blood glucose is at dangerously high levels. Search for insulin in that paper.<p>Ketones don&#x27;t enter into this picture at all as either a toxin or the solution to toxicity. Precisely the point is that ketones can substitute for most of your glucose needs without risking toxicity like glucose does.<p>If all of that isn&#x27;t enough, diabetics often do better following a ketogenic diet [2], not worse. When you can&#x27;t naturally produce enough insulin to process the glucose you consume for daily energy, producing ketones instead is a safe workaround which your body performs naturally.

And in 2018, one company tracking the heart rate of grandmaster Mikhail Antipov concluded that he had burned 560 calories in just two hours. Sitting still. Playing chess. (An average-sized person would need two hours on a treadmill to break 500.)\n  Last week, ESPN looked more closely into the toll the stationary sport takes on the body. ESPN spoke with Robert Sapolsky, a Stanford University researcher who studies primates. Sapolsky explained that some chess players respond to the game like any elite athlete, burning upwards of 6,000 calories a day during tournaments, due to tripled breathing rates, elevated blood pressure, and muscle contractions. That means during tournaments they can lose two pounds each day.\n</code></pre>\nI have done several fasts, and I am quite dubious of the supposed mental improvements. My brain has spent 99%+ of its existence no more than 12 hours away from a steady supply of glucose. I personally feel physically and mentally sluggish.

This doesn&#x27;t mean that the new diet is optimal but it can be a step in the right direction.<p>2. Restricting your diet down to a few types of food is going to remove a lot of allergens. If you only eat meat for example, you are removing literally every single non-meat allergen in your diet - most people have some sort of food sensitivity (lactose intolerance being a common one) so you are going to feel better when you remove those allergens. However, this does not mean that accidental elimination diets are the long term solution. You should slowly add back foods and see what you react to so you can do something less extreme but still feel good doing it.<p>So yes a lot of people feel better on these diets but that does not indicate they are healthy long term or superior to other options.","time":1717255669,"type":"comment"},"40546542":{"by":"Vvector","id":40546542,"parent":40545904,"text":"I remember being queued up to download one song from a specific host.

Rather than impose additional restrictions, Napster execs have decided to take advantage of the impulse. Giving music listeners a central place to trade music files, the company has gambled on its ability to steer the resulting user traffic toward other commercial opportunities.<p>&gt; The sudden success of the Napster model has put the fear in traditional record companies, with good reason. Just days before my Palo Alto meeting with Stallman, U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Patel granted a request filed by the Recording Industry Association of America for an injunction against the file-sharing service. The injunction was subsequently suspended by the U.S. Ninth District Court of Appeals, but by early 2001, the Court of Appeals, too, would find the San Mateo-based company in breach of copyright law,5 a decision RIAA spokesperson Hillary Rosen would later proclaim proclaim a &quot;clear victory for the creative content community and the legitimate online marketplace.&quot;<p>&gt; For hackers such as Stallman, the Napster business model is scary in different ways. The company&#x27;s eagerness to appropriate time-worn hacker principles such as file sharing and communal information ownership, while at the same time selling a service based on proprietary software, sends a distressing mixed message. As a person who already has a hard enough time getting his own carefully articulated message into the media stream, Stallman is understandably reticent when it comes to speaking out about the company. Still, Stallman does admit to learning a thing or two from the social side of the Napster phenomenon.<p>&gt; &quot;Before Napster, I thought it might be OK for people to privately redistribute works of entertainment,&quot; Stallman says. &quot;The number of people who find Napster useful, however, tells me that the right to redistribute copies not only on a neighbor-to-neighbor basis, but to the public at large, is essential and therefore may not be taken away.&quot;<p>. . .<p>&gt; &quot;It&#x27;s a mistake to transfer answers from one thing to another,&quot; says Stallman, contrasting songs with software programs. &quot;The right approach is to look at each type of work and see what conclusion you get.&quot;<p>&gt; When it comes to copyrighted works, Stallman says he divides the world into three categories. The first category involves &quot;functional&quot; works-e.g., software programs, dictionaries, and textbooks. The second category involves works that might best be described as &quot;testimonial&quot;-e.g., scientific papers and historical documents. Such works serve a purpose that would be undermined if subsequent readers or authors were free to modify the work at will. The final category involves works of personal expression-e.g., diaries, journals, and autobiographies. To modify such documents would be to alter a person&#x27;s recollections or point of view-action Stallman considers ethically unjustifiable.<p>&gt; Of the three categories, the first should give users the unlimited right to make modified versions, while the second and third should regulate that right according to the will of the original author. Regardless of category, however, the freedom to copy and redistribute noncommercially should remain unabridged at all times, Stallman insists. If that means giving Internet users the right to generate a hundred copies of an article, image, song, or book and then email the copies to a hundred strangers, so be it. &quot;It&#x27;s clear that private occasional redistribution must be permitted, because only a police state can stop that,&quot; Stallman says. &quot;It&#x27;s antisocial to come between people and their friends. Napster has convinced me that we also need to permit, must permit, even noncommercial redistribution to the public for the fun of it. Because so many people want to do that and find it so useful.&quot;<p>&gt; When I ask whether the courts would accept such a permissive outlook, Stallman cuts me off.<p>&gt; &quot;That&#x27;s the wrong question,&quot; he says. &quot;I mean now you&#x27;ve changed the subject entirely from one of ethics to one of interpreting laws. And those are two totally different questions in the same field. It&#x27;s useless to jump from one to the other. How the courts would interpret the existing laws is mainly in a harsh way, because that&#x27;s the way these laws have been bought by publishers.&quot;<p>&gt; The comment provides an insight into Stallman&#x27;s political philosophy: just because the legal system currently backs up businesses&#x27; ability to treat copyright as the software equivalent of land title doesn&#x27;t mean computer users have to play the game according to those rules. Freedom is an ethical issue, not a legal issue. &quot;I&#x27;m looking beyond what the existing laws are to what they should be,&quot; Stallman says. &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to draft legislation. I&#x27;m thinking about what should the law do? I consider the law prohibiting the sharing of copies with your friend the moral equivalent of Jim Crow. It does not deserve respect.&quot;","time":1717258503,"type":"comment"},"40546934":{"by":"artninja1988","id":40546934,"parent":40546494,"text":"Disagree. DRM is evil and anti consumer.

Some thoughts in no particular order:<p>- &quot;Nginx Unit&quot; is an annoying name to google when you have a problem. You get a lot of nginx results that are of course completely irrelevant to what you&#x27;re looking for, as there is zero actual overlap between the two things. Using quoted search terms is not sufficient to overcome this.<p>- When it works, the all-in-one system feels great.<p>- However sometimes the tightly-coupled nature can be slightly annoying. For example, they publish packages for the various runtimes (ours is python) in the various registries, but only for the &quot;defaults. Concrete example: we are currently running Ubuntu 23.04 but wanted to upgrade to Python 3.12. However Nginx Unit only pre-packages a Python 3.11 package for unit on Ubuntu 23.04 as that is the system-included Python. Had to build our own support from source, which was fairly easy, but still more difficult than our pre-Nginx Unit infra, where all I would have to do is install Python 3.12 and I&#x27;m good to go (because the python runtime wasn&#x27;t at all coupled with the webserver when our stack was Nginx + Python + Gunicorn)<p>- I never properly benchmarked the two in a comprehensive comparison, but Nginx Unit is definitely faster than the aforementioned previous stack. I tested some individual routes (our heaviest&#x2F;most important) and the speedup was 20-40%.<p>- Even when I tell it to keep a minimum number of worker processes around, it kinda seems... not to? I haven&#x27;t properly tested, but sometimes it feels more like serverless, where if I haven&#x27;t sent a request in a while it takes a bit of extra time to spin up a process, but after that requests are snappier. Definitely need to properly investigate this but haven&#x27;t gotten around to it yet. It might just be the difference between allocated memory and not rather than spinning up processes.<p>- It&#x27;s a shame it doesn&#x27;t support SSL via Let&#x27;s Encrypt out-of-the-box, like Caddy. To me that is the biggest (really only) missing piece at the moment.<p>- I much prefer using the HTTP system to manage config than files, and find the Nginx Unit JSON config much, much more readable than either Nginx or Apache configs I&#x27;ve worked with in the past. I&#x27;d also give it a slight edge over caddy configuration.<p>- That said, managing the config (and system in general) can sometimes be annoyingly opaque. The error messages are somewhat terse when updating config fails, so you need to dig into the actual logs to see the error. Just feels a little cat-and-mousey when you could just tell me what the error is up-front, when I&#x27;m sending the config request.<p>In summary, overall I&#x27;ve liked using Nginx Unit, but wish they would: change the name to something less confusing, add built-in Let&#x27;s Encrypt support ala Caddy, and make the errors and overall stack feel a little less opaque &#x2F; black boxy.","time":1717258781,"type":"comment"},"40546974":{"by":"qa-wolf-bates","id":40546974,"parent":40543651,"text":"I think that this article is very interesting","time":1717258788,"type":"comment"},"40546982":{"by":"logicchains","id":40546982,"kids":[40547008],"parent":40546616,"text":"You could copy a book, and sell it.

Basically it used a flood-fill algorithm: your search would be broadcast to all connected peers, which would broadcast it to all peers that hadn&#x27;t seen it yet, until somebody responded with the file and their IP and you could download directly from them.  Interestingly Ethereum uses basically the same algorithm for block distribution, with some optimizations that were first published by RTM, who was one of the founders of YCombinator.<p>Kazaa&#x27;s innovation was to split the peer space into &quot;ordinary nodes&quot; and &quot;superpeers&quot;, with the observation that not all bandwidth links were equal.  It would enlist hosts on high-bandwidth connections to form quasi-centralized indexing nodes to organize the network topology for all the low-bandwidth consumer nodes.

So far I have spent 6 months in Rust and my old tool looks like a toy.  How did I ever live without iterators, algebraic data types, the safety of a strong type system, and especially separate types for arrays and hashmaps for god sakes?<p>Lua makes the scope of learning programming smaller compared to other languages, so it is probably fair to say that it is a good language to learn programming with.  However, knowing the details of heap vs stack, array vs hashmap, and explaining that to someone learning programming for the first time within a language that attempts to hide those details is frustrating.  I can&#x27;t see the smaller picture and view a table simply as a thing that you get and set values from, I can&#x27;t see the weak types as anything more than an annoying source of bugs at runtime, and I crave the borrow checker which saves me from myself.<p>My 10 years of Lua set me up to appreciate Rust&#x27;s fantastic design choices, and I&#x27;m having a great time in Rust land.

As long as your file is less than a few thousand lines of code, the transpiler can run in &lt; ~200ms (and obviously much less for shorter files or much faster if the transpiler is implemented in a faster language).

I took some time to remember the concepts, the abstractions and what the cryptic operators meant in their contexts. I&#x27;ve kept away of Rust for this reason: maintenance would be hard if I only dabble episodicly in Rust.<p>On the other side, my own experience with Lua was not very nice. I contributed (and patched for my needs) Koreader, an ebook reader with 180k lines of Lua. The lack of explicit types and data structures was a strong impediment. And the language has subtle traps... Everything is a table, but not all tables are equals: some tables are sequences (indexed by 1..n) with special operators (like # whose result is undetermined for other tables (which hurts like the famous Undefined Behavior of C++). With Lua, simple questions like &quot;Is this table empty?&quot; or &quot;What is the size of a table?&quot; are too hard for beginners.<p>So, complex artefacts are hard to go back after a long break, but many toys break easily when you come back after a pause, having forgotten how fragile they were.","time":1717272454,"type":"comment"},"40548686":{"by":"bruce511","id":40548686,"kids":[40548739,40548791,40550056,40548718],"parent":40548551,"text":"I&#x27;m old enough to remember when speed was the defining factor for everything.

I would use what makes sense for your application, and not worry about the rest. It&#x27;s a toolbox, not a rulebook. The one point that comes more from experience than from common-sense is to always pin your model versions. As a final tip, if despite trying everything, you still don&#x27;t like the LLM&#x27;s output, just run it again!<p>Here is a summary of all points:<p>1. Focus on Prompting Techniques:<p><pre><code>   1.1. Start with n-shot prompts to provide examples demonstrating tasks.\n   1.2. Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex tasks, making instructions specific.\n   1.3. Incorporate relevant resources via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n</code></pre>\n2. Structure Inputs and Outputs:<p><pre><code>   2.1. Format inputs using serialization methods like XML, JSON, or Markdown.\n   2.2. Ensure outputs are structured to integrate seamlessly with downstream systems.\n</code></pre>\n3. Simplify Prompts:<p><pre><code>   3.1. Break down complex prompts into smaller, focused ones.\n   3.2. Iterate and evaluate each prompt individually for better performance.\n</code></pre>\n4. Optimize Context Tokens:<p><pre><code>   4.1. Minimize redundant or irrelevant context in prompts.\n   4.2. Structure the context clearly to emphasize relationships between parts.\n</code></pre>\n5. Leverage Information Retrieval&#x2F;RAG:<p><pre><code>   5.1. Use RAG to provide the LLM with knowledge to improve output.\n   5.2. Ensure retrieved documents are relevant, dense, and detailed.\n   5.3. Utilize hybrid search methods combining keyword and embedding-based retrieval.\n</code></pre>\n6. Workflow Optimization:<p><pre><code>   6.1. Decompose tasks into multi-step workflows for better accuracy.\n   6.2. Prioritize deterministic execution for reliability and predictability.\n   6.3. Use caching to save costs and reduce latency.\n</code></pre>\n7. Evaluation and Monitoring:<p><pre><code>   7.1. Create assertion-based unit tests using real input&#x2F;output samples.\n   7.2. Use LLM-as-Judge for pairwise comparisons to evaluate outputs.\n   7.3. Regularly review LLM inputs and outputs for new patterns or issues.\n</code></pre>\n8. Address Hallucinations and Guardrails:<p><pre><code>   8.1. Combine prompt engineering with factual inconsistency guardrails.\n   8.2. Use content moderation APIs and PII detection packages to filter outputs.\n</code></pre>\n9. Operational Practices:<p><pre><code>   9.1. Regularly check for development-prod data skew.\n   9.2. Ensure data logging and review input&#x2F;output samples daily.\n   9.3. Pin specific model versions to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected changes.\n</code></pre>\n10. Team and Roles:<p><pre><code>    10.1. Educate and empower all team members to use AI technology.\n    10.2. Include designers early in the process to improve user experience and reframe user needs.\n    10.3. Ensure the right progression of roles and hire based on the specific phase of the project.\n</code></pre>\n11. Risk Management:<p><pre><code>    11.1. Calibrate risk tolerance based on the use case and audience.\n    11.2. Focus on internal applications first to manage risk and gain confidence before expanding to customer-facing use cases.</code></pre>","time":1717273315,"type":"comment"},"40548789":{"by":"optimalsolver","id":40548789,"kids":[40548913,40548869,40548887,40548969],"parent":40544407,"text":"Sorry you invested in commercial real estate, but I&#x27;m not going back to the office.","time":1717273374,"type":"comment"},"40548791":{"by":"koito17","id":40548791,"kids":[40548926,40550203],"parent":40548686,"text":"&gt; Computer sales seldom focus on mhz.<p>For good reason.

There was a noticable delay after clicking which made it not much fun to use. So I spent a couple evenings (hobby time, not company time) to integrate a proper spatial database with a fast spatial index, precache a lot of data, so I didn&#x27;t have to hit the network. It got snappier, I could query a lot of geometry much faster, but it still felt slow. Then I looked into the source of the libraries, and in some react-native glue code I found that the event handler was waiting after the first tap for a double-tap, and thus would only register the tap after a couple hundred ms. One tiny change and it became blazing fast.<p>I believe most apps could do most things instantaneously. Google can find any document on the net in a few ms, after all.

They hate the suburbs too.<p>So when they see something that would enable people who don&#x27;t currently drive cars to drive cars, or for people who live in urban areas to live in suburban areas, they&#x27;re of course going to be against that.<p>&quot;Induced demand&quot; is being used here by languagehacker, as it is used by other people who are opposed to private property, as some sort of technical term that supports their case. But that isn&#x27;t true.<p>By adding more copies of popular books to libraries, we want to induce demand. We want people to read the books, and we want people who don&#x27;t currently use libraries to consider using them. The induced demand is not bad. We had a queue, it was too long, we shorten the queue, and by doing so some people who thought the queue was too long will no longer think that. This is good.<p>What languagehacker is saying, by referring to induced demand, is that, in the opinion of languagehacker cars are bad.<p>It is as simple as that. It sounds super-scientific when you use terms like &quot;induced demand&quot;, but it is not, in fact, super-scientific. It&#x27;s just a value judgement.<p>To me, if you build a highway in an area that has high traffic congestion, and after you build the highway, it still has high traffic congestion, it means more people are getting where they want to be. It&#x27;s called &quot;induced demand&quot;.<p>Induced demand is good.

To make <i>any</i> money off an album most bands need to sell tens of thousands of records. Most records never sell anywhere close to that number.<p>Record labels are basically loan companies. They sign a band on a contract for X number of albums. The royalties of those albums is then divided up among the label, the song writer(s), often the engineers and producers, and then the actual performers on the recording. A majority of the royalties are kept by the labels with the rest divided up among everyone else.<p>For signing this contract the artist is often given an advance. The label will also front money for studio time, recordings, and promotional work. Most of that fronted money the artist owes to the label so they start in arrears. When an album is purchased the label keeps the artist&#x27;s royalties until their advance and other &quot;recoupables&quot; are paid back. It&#x27;s only <i>then</i> an artist actually makes money off their album sales. The only ones that even begin to see money from album sales are ones that manage many tens of thousands of sales. Most artists never sell enough albums to pay back their advance.<p>Amortized over time an advance for a record for most artists is pretty paltry. In order to make a living with music they need to tour or luck out with a licensing deal.<p>The money for artists has always been in touring.

There is so much more built out of the comprehensive road network everywhere than there is with transit. Cities are barely establishing their cardinal direction rail transit routes today.

Once you&#x27;ve put in the effort to learn the characters (as about a billion people have), it&#x27;s very difficult to accept their replacement by what is viewed as a script for children.","time":1717279894,"type":"comment"},"40549503":{"by":"Hamuko","id":40549503,"parent":40549277,"text":"Or if you live outside the US, just vanished, since it has never shipped.","time":1717279894,"type":"comment"},"40549504":{"by":"asdasdsddd","id":40549504,"kids":[40549886,40551208,40551034,40550593],"parent":40549319,"text":"pinyin is the best thing that happened to the language after simplification.<p>Not only did it propel literacy rates to basically 100%, but it added a phonetic component to the language","time":1717279907,"type":"comment"},"40549505":{"by":"em-bee","id":40549505,"parent":40549012,"text":"in some cities where traffic was reduced in specific areas (usually the center), business went up, because, as more people were forced to walk, they also were more spontaneously entering shops and buying more.","time":1717279914,"type":"comment"},"40549506":{"by":"rangestransform","id":40549506,"parent":40538228,"text":"Yes, I would say that biking with a child in certain parts of the US is incredibly irresponsible and neglectful","time":1717279926,"type":"comment"},"40549510":{"by":"rangestransform","id":40549510,"parent":40535330,"text":"I would rather be safe than bear a cross for the environment<p>I’m glad we live in a democracy where telling people to endanger themselves for the environment is a nonstarter","time":1717279962,"type":"comment"},"40549511":{"by":"HDThoreaun","id":40549511,"kids":[40549952,40550319],"parent":40549270,"text":"I think to would be extremely difficult to make the bus better than driving for people that already have a car.

This adds a delay.<p>I mean:  Go ahead and try it right now.  I&#x27;ll wait.<p>And sure, it might be a small delay:  After all, it can&#x27;t be more than a few milliseconds per click, right[2]?

I&#x27;d press the &quot;cast&quot; button, and a dynamic list of candidate devices would show up.  I&#x27;d try to select the appropriate candidate and before my thumb could move the fraction of an inch to push the button, the list had changed as more candidate devices were discovered -- so the wrong device was selected.<p>So I then had to dismantle the stream that I&#x27;d just started on the wrong device, and try (and fail) again.<p>[2]:  But even small delays add up.

Thousands of them are semanto-phonetic compounds, meaning they combine a character relating to the word&#x27;s (or syllable&#x27;s) meaning with a character relating to pronunciation. Sinitic languages tend to have a lot of homophones or near-homophones, so this approach works reasonably well as a memory aid once you&#x27;ve memorized a bunch of the basic characters.<p>One problem is that many of the pronunciations have drifted from the Middle Chinese pronunciation of the words. Also, some of them have been simplified in Simplified Chinese which makes the components a bit harder to discern.<p>I&#x27;ve been learning some Cantonese recently and this is very apparent with certain common Cantonese words. For example, the first-person pronoun in Cantonese is pronounced ngo, with a low-rising tone, and written like this:<p>我 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;1&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;1&#x2F;</a><p>The word for goose in Cantonese is also &quot;ngo&quot;, but with a different tone. Here&#x27;s the character for that:<p>鵝 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;1200&#x2F;?full=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;1200...</a><p>If you enlarge it, you&#x27;ll see that the left side is the same 我 from before. The right side is 鳥, which means &quot;bird&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;161&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;161&#x2F;</a>). So if you saw this character and knew the basic characters for the pronouns and the word &quot;bird&quot;, and you spoke Cantonese, you&#x27;d be able to easily understand what it meant.<p>Here&#x27;s another one. The word &quot;ngo&quot; with still a different tone means &quot;hungry&quot;. How do we write it?<p>餓: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;740&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;740&#x2F;</a><p>In this one the phonetic component is on the right instead, which is a bit inconsistent. The left side is this:<p>食: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;116&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;characters&#x2F;116&#x2F;</a><p>What does 食 mean? It&#x27;s the verb &quot;to eat&quot;. So if you saw this 餓 character and knew a couple of other basic characters, you could figure out that it&#x27;s the word &quot;ngo6&quot; meaning &quot;hungry&quot;. Many of the characters still work like this although the sound shift I mentioned above means that some work in some Chinese languages and not others.","time":1717282949,"type":"comment"},"40549864":{"by":"lovecg","id":40549864,"kids":[40549893],"parent":40549743,"text":"&gt; Spending time horizontal while not asleep is very unhealthy for your heart.<p>Never heard of this before, any references?","time":1717282955,"type":"comment"},"40549874":{"by":"m463","id":40549874,"kids":[40549994,40549956],"parent":40549848,"text":"isn&#x27;t paper substantial while magnetic patterns are insubstantial?","time":1717283061,"type":"comment"},"40549876":{"deleted":true,"id":40549876,"parent":40549791,"time":1717283079,"type":"comment"},"40549881":{"by":"Maarten88","id":40549881,"kids":[40555524],"parent":40549672,"text":"&gt; I’ve read articles where even on a per capita basis just about everything is more costly in dense cities, from sewers to schools.<p>Link?

Yeah, as the cost of travel goes up, people make various decisions: bite-the-bullet, find alternatives, delay, consolidate, and&#x2F;or go without. As the cost decreases, the incentives to find alternatives, delay or consolidate trips goes down (which means roads are then used for less important reasons and less efficiently - why go to the grocery store once a week if you can go every day in half the travel time?)<p>I would agree, at some point when all alternatives are equally unattractive (or non-existent), then going without is a more attractive option.<p>Though, the &quot;consolidate&quot; option is a big one to consider. Rather than going to the city every day, perhaps people could do so every other day for the same benefit. If traffic is bad, then people will go less often (frequency of travel is a function of cost). Thus, in some cases, highway expansion is filled by people that want to go to the grocery store every day rather than going once a week. Meanwhile, those that commute to work, are still going to do so because they have to. If the commute gets too bad, then some people will decide to move.<p>On the other side of the spectrum, at some point there are so many people that want to go into the city every day - you can&#x27;t do it with single occupancy vehicles and roads. It&#x27;s a scaling problem. For example, someone did an analysis of parking decks in Seattle and whether there were not enough of them. They found if there were all filled and everyone then tried to leave - it would take 2 days for all the vehicles to exit the city.<p>There are certainly many aspects to consider.","time":1717284384,"type":"comment"},"40550007":{"by":"stevenAthompson","id":40550007,"kids":[40554583],"parent":40549401,"text":"I suspect that the person you&#x27;re responding to is critical of psychology, so they read my comment to imply something contrary to their very strange worldview and responded accordingly.<p>I could, of course, be very wrong.

However, the VList was designed to be used for a Lisp implementation, for which there may still be other benefits.<p><pre><code>    msb = 8*sizeof(size_t) - __builtin_clz(idx)\n</code></pre>\nOr in Java<p><pre><code>    msb = Long.SIZE - Long.numberOfLeadingZeroes(idx)\n</code></pre>\nThis Multi-Array queue could perhaps benefit from this previous work. In particular, if you constrain the data arrays to be powers of 2 in size, you can use the MSB calculation to very quickly determine the index of the sub-array in the &quot;rings&quot; array, and by masking out the MSB, you determine the index in the sub-array. The RAOTS paper is a forgotten gem which every language developer should be aware of when they&#x27;re implementing lists in their stdlib. They can be used for immutable lists too in place of linked lists, as cons only requires copying the contents of one sub-array and copying the rings array. In fact, you can modify it slightly to make the rings array a plain old linked-list to make this even cheaper for consing immutable lists, at the cost of slower random-access.<p>[1]:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;research&#x2F;tr&#x2F;1999&#x2F;09&#x2F;CS-99-09.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;research&#x2F;tr&#x2F;1999&#x2F;09&#x2F;CS-99-09.pdf</a><p>[2]:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.ac.uk&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;147902641.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.ac.uk&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;147902641.pdf</a>","time":1717289416,"type":"comment"},"40550456":{"by":"numpad0","id":40550456,"kids":[40550791],"parent":40549371,"text":"&gt; why not just adopt Japanese<p>Because Japanese characters have no direct relation to Chinese phonetics.

What does it take to survive and thrive?  I might describe my programming career as being kind of a refugee: on the web, I moved from plain .asp to Perl, fled Perl for Python ...<p>At the start, a language needs the ability to evolve.  I recall reading a book on Python before I adopted it, a book which was so off-putting that I ended up delaying my attempts to use Python, and it went on about Python&#x27;s philosophy when it came to division.  I knew that, at some point, Python would have to change away from integer division by default.  And it eventually did.  It was a mistake because it was non-obvious, and the language changed to fix it.  Good.<p>Now, though, all kinds of things have crept into Python which are decidedly <i>non-Pythonic</i>: the walrus operator, which looks like something that escaped from a Perl dungeon; the docopt module, which has a weird trap of it being a module you <i>must</i> know about, but only if someone has decided to use it; the utter shambles which is the whole environment and library packaging &quot;let entirely too many ways to do it exist;&quot; or the community&#x27;s preference for Requests while it somehow has yet to be co-opted into the standard library.  I am sure I have gored someone&#x27;s ox here.<p>Perhaps a language needs a certain window before it is finally frozen in place.  Or a more stringent, forceful mandate than the Zen of Python, which I think has been Not Enough.  In a way, I am reminded of the Agile Manifesto, which was well-intentioned but had no enforcement, no orthodoxy; it lacked teeth to nip at the heels of those who fail, who go astray.

My life was greatly improved by having a car and while a car is more expensive technically, in indirect costs, it feels like a break even to me. At least as someone who buys cheap cars, tends to live within 30mins drive of my job and keeps them for a good long time. Even in a good public transit area in the US there is a significant time sink to using public transit for literally every aspect of your life. Getting to work is efficient and not significantly more time intensive than driving, but doing everything else like visiting a friend, going to a hair salon, get groceries can be a huge difference depending on what city you&#x27;re in. I lived in a city where I was faster to take the bus to work than drive, but getting groceries was a harrowing 45mins journey. Places where getting to work took twice as long, but I could walk to the grocery store. In the US there&#x27;s just no way to make public transit really work across all dimensions. Especially as we add in specificity. Like needing to bring home a large amount of items or visit humans instead of businesses.

This is also sounds like an underfunded and sparse bus system. You can do buses right or you can do them poorly, same with anything. If you have a dense enough network that most people don&#x27;t have to transfer, or enough frequency it doesn&#x27;t matter, it makes a huge difference. Public transportation (and particularly buses and coaches) are ubiquitous in some transportation systems in some very rich world cities. London comes to mind. The double decker buses are beloved.<p>Bus rapid transit can actually be really nice. You know that rock stars and politicians practically live on buses while they do traveling events? Of course a BRT isn&#x27;t going to be that private luxury, but even a middle quality charter bus that makes limited stops is pretty darn good. Having dedicated lanes removed the worst part of buses compared to trains.<p>I used to daily take the AC Transit transbay buses from the East Bay to San Francisco, which are double-decker Greyhounds and have comfortable reclining seating with tables and wifi. The single entrance&#x2F;exit is a benefit, because it only runs commuter hours and so in the morning it only picks up in the East Bay and drops off in SF. It allows enforcement of fares too. It&#x27;s a higher fare, but that also attracts a commuter clientele. The main problem with it is that it is too popular and gets crowded, and you&#x27;re SOL if all the buses are already full at your stop. But that if the flaw is that it is too popular, that&#x27;s the best and easiest problem to have.

I live in a very car-centric area (zero public transportation, with many things too far away for realistically walking there).<p>To throw some numbers out:  A &quot;cheap&quot; used car ($5k), financed over 3 years at 8% is $156.68 per month.  At my middle age, decent full coverage insurance is around $100 per month (it would cost a lot more if I were still younger).  We&#x27;re at $256.68 monthly just to have a car that we may elect to drive.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t include parking for the car (a place to live with good parking tends to cost more than a place with awful parking).  It also doesn&#x27;t include the costs of actually driving the car, like regular maintenance, stuff that inevitably breaks or wears out, fuel, washing the car, and so on.  Let&#x27;s just make up a number and say that these things average ~$150 per month, for a total of ~$406.68 per month to drive a car.<p>Now, suppose that a commute is 20 minutes each way using that car, or 1 hour if riding the bus.  And that a bus pass costs $62 per month.<p>And let&#x27;s say that a person &quot;brings home&quot; $25 per hour worked, and that they work 40 hours in a regular week (173.93 hours in a regular month), and that the commute time counts as unpaid work.<p>The car commute adds 14.49 hours per month, for 188.42 hours total time in work+commute at a cost of $406.68.<p>The bus commute adds 43.48 hours per month, for 217.41 hours total time in work+commute at a cost of $62.<p>The bus seems cheaper and slower at this point, which we all probably implicitly knew to be true.<p>--<p>But if my math is right:  By the time transportation is paid for, the person commuting by car has an effective hourly wage of $20.92 for their time+commute.  And the person riding the bus has an effective hourly wage of $19.73&#x2F;hour for their time+commute.<p>So owning and driving the car <i>may</i> be a better option than taking the bus, depending on a person&#x27;s specific situation and proclivities.  And of course, it&#x27;s more nuanced than that in ways that are harder to math out.<p>With a car, commute time is just lost time.  A person driving a car must drive that car the entire time; they don&#x27;t get to read a book or hang out on HN or whatever, but they&#x27;re only doing that for 40 minutes a day.<p>With a bus pass, commute time might be productive time.  A person riding a bus might decide to read a book or hang out on HN or whatever.  So if a person chooses to do so, they can use some of that 43.48 hours riding back and forth to work doing something that has meaning to them.<p>On the other hand:  Owning a cheap(ish) car means being able to travel to places where a bus doesn&#x27;t go, and do so on a whim, and (optionally) take a mountain of stuff along with them if that is useful for whatever reason.<p>So yeah, cars are expensive.

The traditional solution was lowering the density by replacing houses with roads, but that&#x27;s no longer popular.<p>Traffic is a hard problem. There is no single solution that fits everywhere, and you will never be able to go everywhere with your preferred means of transit. At least if you are not a major political leader such as the US president. If you are, you can just stop the normal traffic and let the peasants wait.","time":1717302430,"type":"comment"},"40551345":{"by":"ethbr1","id":40551345,"kids":[40555758],"parent":40550933,"text":"&gt; <i>Just got back from Atlanta.

Implied in cross functional management is: who&#x27;s your customer?<p>Specific example:<p>I worked on a team (major NYC financial provider 15K+ people) with extremely heavy use of Oracle. There was a separate DBA team that setup, maintained DBs, and owned all the schema passwords and did rollouts.<p>I made over several attempts very specific requests to the DBA TL on what our team  needed. The DBA TL yes-ed me to death then told me about his solution. I explained why that was a non starter --- all this 1:1.<p>Later during a team meeting he opened with we&#x27;ll do what I asked for --- so it he said --- then proceeded for the next 1hr talking again about his vision. I had none of it.<p>He was upset and escalated to management. So now I&#x27;m in a 3-way with my boss and his boss and they&#x27;re reading me the riot act. Then my boss said, well, I guess he has his own vision of what to do. That was the break I needed. I made stunningly clear the following points:<p>1. We&#x27;re the customer. We&#x27;re the ones with ultimate accountability to paying external customers. We tell the internal service supplier if their product is good, and whether or not its worth the time of day. They don&#x27;t tell us. We tell them our requirements. They don&#x27;t tell us.<p>2. I had to remind them that in commercial transactions outside of corporate America, the customer is in charge because the customer has the checkbook (well, for those who have a backbone). And the supplier needs to be minimally mindful of customer satisfaction or else they&#x27;re fired, legal action etc. etc.<p>3. But in corporate America internal service suppliers have management&#x27;s implicit buy-in. Internal customers can&#x27;t shop around or do it themselves. They&#x27;re stuck with the internal suppliers like it or not. And that gives political players and stupid people the upper hand even though we&#x27;re still paying for their salary, machines, and oracle licenses through our team&#x27;s revenues.<p>4. I expected management to convey that to the DBA lead, and comply with our team&#x27;s requirements.<p>The boss&#x27; boss sat there confused.<p>So I said this: wanna know why some companies move IT into the cloud? Because first tech people get sick and tired of the crappy internal suppliers. Over a few years, slow&#x2F;bad internal service leads to too many business delays. And after a while business guys with budget get pissed. Then they announce: cloud.<p>That finally sunk in, and the DBA TL was chastised. But it was a cost to me.<p>See? Internal customer, internal service supplier is cross functional management is about the proper way teams should work together to satisfy internal customers and transitively external customers.<p>Where did I get that from: The Executive by Drucker.<p>Let me close this way: I absolutely learned nothing of any substance from managers in NYC finance. I learned this gem from a book. The rest I mainly owe to a manager in VA, and my first boss (UC Berkeley Chem-Eng) in Silicon Valley.

Previously unknown images and videos are also to be scrutinised using “artificial intelligence” technology. If a user refuses the scanning, they would be blocked from sending or receiving images, photos, videos and links (Article 10). End-to-end encrypted services such as Whatsapp or Signal would have to implement the automated searches “prior to transmission” of a message (so-called client-side scanning, Article 10a). The initially proposed scanning of text messages for indications of grooming, which is hardly being used to date, is to be scrapped, as is the scanning of voice communication, which has never been done before.

I assume you, like most people, think people probably just tended to start dropping dead around 40, if not earlier. In reality, people tended to live comparably long to modern times, if they made it to adulthood. It&#x27;s just that infant mortality was <i>way</i> higher. If one guy dies in childbirth, and another dies at 80 - you have a life expectancy of 40.<p>You can find evidence for this in numerous ways. For instance studies looking at classical Greeks &#x27;of renown&#x27;, found a median life expectancy was 70, and average life expectancy was 71.3. [1] Even in the Bible one finds numbers that match up basically exactly, &#x27;Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.&#x27; You can also find things like the <i>minimum</i> age for Roman Consuls being 42 years, and so on endlessly.<p>And all of this was in an era when there were no vaccines, no knowledge of germs or how disease spread, and when cutting edge medical science had to do with balancing the 4 humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) with some sort of an elemental association of air&#x2F;water&#x2F;fire&#x2F;earth with each. Eating well and exercising can indeed take you <i>extremely</i> far, because it damn sure wasn&#x27;t their healthcare doing it.

Odd feeling.<p>My artificial eye sits on top of what they called a frame, which had to be installed at the same time my old eye was removed.

The company that made it was very proud as this was the first Caucasian eye they had made. Nonetheless, when I am outside I still wear an eyepatch.

You fold the ballot, and put it in a big urn. At the end of the voting day, representatives of all parties and anyone else who registered as an observer opens the urn and they all count the votes. They report the counts higher up electronically, and safely store the physical ballots. Elections happen on a Sunday, from 8 AM to 8 PM, sometimes with local extensions where a polling station is still full at the close. Preliminary results from exit polls are announced immediately at 8PM by the media. The electoral officials announce the first official preliminary results by 22PM, and then throughout the night. By 12 PM the next day, the vote count and official final results are typically out.<p>No &quot;hanging chads&quot;, etc. There are plenty of other electoral issues (busing, paying for votes, strong local cliques where even representatives of different parties conspire to steal votes for a single party, bad education leading to people not knowing their rights or who to vote for, etc).

After the example prompt, I tried to learn about a table and it generated bad SQL (correct query to pull a row, but with limit 0). I asked it to show me the DDL and it generated invalid SQL. Then I tried to ask it to do some population statistics on the customer table and ended up confused about why there appears to be two windows in the cell, with the previously generated SQL on the left and the newly generated SQL on the right. The new SQL wouldn&#x27;t run when I hit run cell, the error showed the originally generated SQL. I gave up and bounced.<p>I went back while writing this comment and realized it might be showing me a diff (better use of color would have helped, I have been trained by github). But I was at a loss for what to do with that. I just now figured out the Keep button exists and it accepted the diff and now it sort of makes sense, but the SQL still doesn&#x27;t return any results.<p>My honest feedback is that there is way too much stuff I don&#x27;t understand on the screen and it makes me confused and a little stressed. Ease me into it please, I&#x27;m dumb. There seems to be cells that are linked together and cells that aren&#x27;t(? separated by purplish background) and I don&#x27;t understand it. I am a jupyter user and I feel like this should be intuitive to me, but it isn&#x27;t.

I feel lost in a sea of white.<p>But the core issue is that, excluding the prompt I copy-pasted word for word which worked like a charm, I am 0 out of 4 on actually leveraging AI to solve the problems I asked of Magic. I like the concept of natural language BI (I worked on in the early days when Alexa came out) so I probably gave it more chances than I would have for a different product.<p>For me, it doesn&#x27;t fit my criteria for good problems to solve with AI in 2024 - the conversational interface and binary right&#x2F;wrong nature of querying&#x2F;presenting data accurately make the cost of failure too high, which is a death sentence for AI products IMO (compare to proactive, non-blocking products like copilot or shades-of-wrong problems like image generation or conversations with imaginary characters). But text-to-SQL and data presentation make sense as AI capabilities in 2024 so I can see why that could be a good product to pursue.

They report the counts higher up electronically, and safely store the physical ballots.</i><p>What you describe is exactly what happens in byzantine-fault-tolerant networks, and much more. But because it is done by machines, the cost is brought down by orders of magnitude so now many groups can have decision making and votes about many things every day, rather than spending billions once every few years and manually counting. This technology is made available to all, as opposed to, say, trusting the operators of a StackExchange site to not rig the periodic elections for moderators and those who will run the site. And it allows the communities eg DAOs to collectively manage larger amounts of money without worrying some director will abscond with it.<p>The REAL conflation has been by crypto-haters of decentralized protocols with centralized entities like FTX or Celsius. The only thing they have in common with crypto is that you can send crypto to the address they control. And then, they pinky promise they’ll take care of it. Crypto has been developed exactly to <i>remove</i> the need for such middlemen! While FTX fell, UniSwap and Aave Protocol didnt miss a beat. No one worries a UniSwap smart contract will rugpull then one day. Government regulation isnt needed when the code has been battle tested with billions of dollars. Just like government regulation of HTTP isnt needed even though it was needed for physical mail delivery. That’s the kind of building blocks we need for a future system — for voting too. Cheaper faster better.<p>It is a bit like arguing email and the world wide web is worse than the gold standard of regular mail. Look at how much innovation it has unleashed once given the chance to build on top.

When we&#x27;re discussing capitalism, people seem to get it in their head that it&#x27;s either what we have now, or you can fuck off to North Korea.<p>How I would characterize my ideal economy is one where the feedback loop works: people can make reasonable guesses about what a product is, how long it will work for, and what its cost is. They can adjust their purchases according to their needs, which tells us which products should exist and which should not. Businesses do not trick the customers into thinking a thing has more value than it actually does. A very large part of this economy is accurate information, and a very large part of accurate information is trust. After all nobody is going to know more about the product than the people who made it, and they will always have an interest in representing their product in the most positive light. Lemon problem.<p>The thing that seems to characterize the economy now is that businesses will violate your trust in order to make money. They know that you won&#x27;t read the license agreement when you sign up for a service, and they will use that. They know that you won&#x27;t be checking what kind of joins your sofa has. They know that you won&#x27;t get as much value from their items as the adverts say. All of these abuses can be done within the law, perhaps because these same businesses are involved with shaping the law.<p>The feedback loop is broken, and this leads to the same problem as what the Soviet Union had. Their problem wasn&#x27;t that people were lazy and didn&#x27;t go to work. Their problem was that they made the wrong stuff. Things that nobody wanted, often with the same quality issues as what you get these days buying an item from a market economy. Note that GDP figures will still not know this, it just sees all the crap and counts the money paid for it.<p>Often we pick on MBAs when it comes to this sort of critique, and there&#x27;s some merit to it. If your only goal is to make money, and the economy is riddled with loopholes where you can make money without providing value, then we will have an economy that doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of value, because MBAs are really good at finding these types of things.","time":1717315902,"type":"comment"},"40552365":{"by":"tempodox","id":40552365,"parent":40535868,"text":"Leave it to Microsoft to come up with nonsensical stuff, be it names or something like this.

I used it for several years before going elsewhere. I wrote a graphical toolkit with animations in it (based on pango&#x2F;cairo), embedded it for a business-objects platform and used in Quik trading platform for trading bots.<p>It’s very nice, but it has rough edges that never get addressed, despite being proposed in the mailing list in every proposal phase.<p>__newindex only works once, then it’s not “new” anymore. You have to proxy your table with an empty table and a metatable, also make sure you now implement all metamethods for your proxy table to be indexable, iterable, #-able, tostringable and so on. No __setindex for you. Every version of Lua has little changes in there (it uses no semver), so your 5.x iteration protocol&#x2F;etc are bound to that x. Why would you upgrade then? Cause every 5.x lacks something you really want and it’s in 5.&lt;x+1&gt;. There’s also something you don’t want.<p>“a and b or c” and “b or c” paradigm doesn’t work with boolean “false”, because it’s unsurprisingly as false as nil. It’s not haskell vibes, it’s a lack of ?: and ?? operators right there. Nil&#x2F;false are basically second class citizens in Lua cause only these two share the same room, also nil is prohibited from any array.<p>Lua ignores most syntactic ergonomics. You can’t destructure a table, everything has to be “local a, b, c = t.a, t.b, t.c”. And vice versa: “{a=a, b=b, c=c}”, which is syntactically non-fixable due to table duality. Its “…” literal has inconvenient semantics of collapsing before another argument: f(…, x) is equivalent to f({…}[1], x). So you have to “local t = {…}; table.insert(t, x); f(unpack(t))”. No way you can get something like t.push(x) either, for reasons too long for a medium sized comment. Lua is also highly function-esque, but there’s no way to shorten “function (x) return &lt;mylambda&gt; end”.<p>Also its gc is pretty much stop the world. They experimented with it in recent versions, but at 5.1 times you didn’t expect your complex scripts to not freeze for a substantial amount of frames if you “wow so simple”d them and created {} here and there. It takes time to collect the garbage.<p>Rocks, Lua package manager tends to build everything locally, but your windows box ecosystem is out of luck. If you can’t find a pre-built dll, you’re in the mud. That’s windows fault, but your problem at the end of the day. Luckily you can make it yourself, cause Lua has great C API and LuaJIT has ffi. No &#x2F;s here, I made all my wrappers and connectors myself.<p>Overall it’s a nice language idea, fully functional prototype, you name it. It works in the falling in love phase and has unique features for a non-esoteric lang. But don’t expect too much from it in a “marriage” if you’re one of those who want things to get out your way and you don’t get why an obvious feature cannot be done for ideological reasons while compatibility gets broken regularly anyway.<p>I understand that this post looks negative, but that’s because it enumerates only downsides, which are real, although sometimes subjective.

An image of a chair and a birthday cake with a number of candles could indicate a date of protest.

They&#x27;re blaming file sharing for the &quot;scene&quot; changing from factors entirely unrelated to file sharing.<p>1) In the 90s &quot;record&quot; sales were anomalously high. Record companies not only published new music CDs but republished fifty years of back catalogs either in compilations or CD reissues of albums that had long been out of print.<p>2) Movie soundtrack albums became big business. The 90s saw dozens of movie soundtracks go multi-platinum and many many more go gold. That was mostly unheard of in decades past.<p>3) Retail chains leaned into CD sales, some like Best Buy selling them near cost at times to pull in halo sales of other products. Specialty retail chains also grew during this time.<p>4) Malls as retail hubs also exploded during this time putting record stores in easy reach of more people.<p>5) Consolidation in FM radio and &quot;format&quot; stations massively increased the reach of label promoters. No longer did they need to deal with thousands of individual DJs, they could just don&#x27;t-call-it-Payola-but-it-still-was promote stuff to programming directors and it would get on the air in a hundred markets.<p>6) CDs being much cheaper to manufacture allowed more independent labels to actually manufacture records for sale. Smaller labels serving niche genres were able to get in more records manufactured for sale.<p>7) Music got much cheaper to actually record and produce DAWs that just got cheaper and more capable. By the end of the decade you could record an album in a living room or garage and it could sound really good.<p>8) CD players became incredibly cheap and omnipresent. Every PC, portable stereo, car, and most game consoles (save Nintendo) ended up with built-in CD players.<p>All of these factors combined to form a massive sales bubble around CDs. It peaked around 2000 mostly because the anomalous sales of back catalog stuff reached a saturation point. It didn&#x27;t totally burst because there was still a long tail of niche music being sold alongside megahits.<p>The sales of CDs dropped as sales through services like iTunes increased. Then further with streaming services.<p>While file sharing got a lot of attention it actually had a very small effect on music industry financials. Music buyers still bought music. The CD bubble burst because the back catalog sales had reached saturation.<p>The music scene changing in Boston or elsewhere after 2000 is more related to economic trends. Record chains overextended themselves and went out of business, they thought CD sales would continue forever. Chains like Best Buy, Walmart, and B&amp;N ate their lunch because they could sell CDs cheaper. They could price CDs lower because they made their nut on other products. Music was just another thing to get people in the door. Apple and Amazon put the hurt on those chains with online sales.<p>Pretending every downloaded track on Napster was a &quot;lost&quot; CD sale is record label propaganda.

It doesn&#x27;t matter how much demand you generate if increasing supply is constrained by law. Whereas if you could fix the zoning and building codes then you wouldn&#x27;t need to induce demand because demand is already there -- it&#x27;s why housing is so expensive.<p>&gt; There are many other considerations that need to be taken into consideration to make trains useful: frequency, right-of-way on road crossings (often a problem for light rail)<p>These are all density again. You get frequency by having enough passengers to fill the transit car on that interval, which you get from higher density. There is no point in sending a bus to carry one person to one house, it might as well be a car.<p>This is also why right of way and bus lanes are the wrong way to think about it. If you don&#x27;t have enough density you&#x27;re going to lose regardless and all the bus lane is going to do is make the traffic worse, because people can&#x27;t take the bus if it doesn&#x27;t go where they&#x27;re going when they&#x27;re going there and then you&#x27;re just wasting a lane. Whereas if you do have the density then you still don&#x27;t build a bus lane because instead you build a subway.<p>&gt; In a lot of suburbia, there are large parking lots near train stations. In theory, your point is a great advertisement for this setup.<p>That&#x27;s trying to have it both ways. If you have to drive to the train station then you have to buy a car and insure it and unless the parking at the train station is free you&#x27;re now paying for parking. At this point people start wondering why they&#x27;re hoofing it up to the train platform and paying for transit tickets and waiting for the train instead of just driving the rest of the way to their destination.<p>To fix this you need more people to live within walking distance of mass transit. Which is to say, you need to build higher density housing or allow mixed zoning so people can live closer to where they work.","time":1717322805,"type":"comment"},"40552882":{"by":"TeMPOraL","id":40552882,"parent":40552825,"text":"The goal isn&#x27;t necessarily to eliminate the bottom tier from the market.

Maybe it’s survivorship bias or something? Because cheaply furniture definitely existed more than 15 years ago.<p>I found a vintage ad for a “genuine leather” sofa for $799. I.e., the worst kind of leather, the kind with the cracking plasticky texture. I don’t think that sofa would have even reached the upholstery guy, it would have ended up in a dumpster. (Search for Gardner White Vintage Ads on Google Images)<p>That $799 couch in 1990 would now cost $2,000 after inflation. So $2,000 is your baseline for a mass-produced cheap couch (this lines up pretty closely to the $1500 IKEA leather couch I own), which means something more “buy it for life” is going to bring you into that Restoration Hardware territory. And, really, most people aren’t willing to pay that.<p>The second thing I would say is that this idea that modern capitalism wants to stamp out this family business is not supported at all. This whole situation seemed to make their services even more valuable. It’s also a fact that in the US 99.9% of all businesses are small businesses and they employ almost half of all Americans. Yes, you heard that right, it’s really 99.9%.<p>Small businesses are where you’ll find a lot of quality furniture too!

That isn’t what causes your furniture to fail prematurely. And it has major benefits like being lightweight. My sofa from IKEA is 100% manufactured wood, but that part is totally solid.

The gap is simply too wide.<p>I live in the Boston area and commute by car. My commute by car (despite the recent closure of a lane on the most heavily trafficked road on my commute, for no reason other than to not have it) is between 25 and 45 minutes. The fastest I can pull it off by public transit is an hour, with a long tail up to 1h20m or more in case of shutdowns, etc. I’d gladly take public transit if I could even meet my worst-case commute time consistently, but the worsening of my life by doubling my average commute time far outweighs the benefit of being a little greener and not having to pay attention to driving during my commute.<p>In other areas of the economy we wouldn’t consider inducing demand for alternative remedies by making the way average person operates worse. It becomes quite dystopian in my opinion. For instance, one could argue that too many people are seeking healthcare rather than pursuing lifestyle changes to improve their health, due to the availability of healthcare, so we should shut down hospitals. Or one could argue that the presence of housing induces demand for housing and so we should stop building new houses while providing no additional place for people to live. That will just create homelessness and&#x2F;or very expensive housing. Both of these solutions will lower demand, but in a quite painful way for many people.<p>To me the solution which makes far more sense is to build improved public transit and people will naturally gravitate toward it, reducing demand for roads&#x2F;cars, AND their quality of life will improve. For instance, if Boston expanded the MBTA with the long-sought-after urban ring project [1], my commute would reduce to perhaps 30-35 minutes by train. At that point it would be an absolute no brainer for me to switch all my commutes to public transit.<p>This is a rare situation where almost everyone really can win. Easier, cheaper, faster, greener travel.

U-235 has a  half-life of 700 million years and a spontaneous fission (SF) probability of 7e-11. U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years and a SF probability of 5.4e-7. So on average it takes 6 times longer for a U-238 to decay than U-235, but when it does it has a probability to do it by spontaneous fission that is 7000 times higher. Add to that that U-238 is 141 times more plentiful in natural uranium, and you get that you can completely ignore U-235 when it comes to spontaneous fission.<p>1 kg of Uranium is about 4.2 moles. Each has 6e23 atoms (Avogadro&#x27;s number), that&#x27;s a total of about 25e23 atoms. Every year about 1 in 4.5 billion of those will decay one way or another. That&#x27;s 5.5e14 decay events. The probability of spontaneous fission is 5.4e-7, so basically 10 million of these decay events are SF. There are 32 million seconds in a year, so I am getting about 0.3 SF events per second. On average a fission event generates about 2.5 neutrons, so that&#x27;s close to 1 neutron per second.<p>They are getting 10 per second.

In the USA, both the public and the political leadership was frightened of the slow buildup of inflation from 1960 to 1973, and then the explosion of inflation, into double digit territory, for much of the period from 1973 to 1982. After that experience we had a long era, a whole generation of leadership, where the public and the leadership felt the fight against inflation had to be one of the most important economic fights that the government engaged in. And the fight against inflation had to involve the fight against gross margins. So we, as a society, went to war against small businesses, because small businesses survive on the kind of margins that were seen as causing inflation. By contrast, allowing the spread of companies such as WalMart, which benefits from &quot;economies of scale&quot; and so can survive on razor-thin gross margins, was seen as helping to stop inflation. Likewise, opening up the economy to nations such as China was seen as an important step to limit inflation. The cost structure in China was such that a company in China could have fat gross margins and yet still underprice a company in the USA that had thin gross margins. Thus importing from China became an important part of the war against inflation.<p>All of this worked for awhile. The era from 1982 to 2008 was known as The Great Moderation, an era when inflation fell and the business cycle moderated. And the era after 2008 also saw rock bottom inflation -- inflation remained under the Fed&#x27;s 2% target for several years after 2008.<p>Under President Trump, the USA began to adapt a new economic policy, and President Biden has continued forward with the Trump policies. The new era has seen increasing tariffs on China and a willingness to rethink some aspects of the open trade policies that we followed for most of 50 years. And since 2000, starting under Trump and then continuing under Biden, we have seen several trillion worth of stimulus spending. This has revived inflation, but it has also allowed many small businesses to raise prices and thus re-attain the kinds of gross margins they need to survive.<p>In general, a society can have the lowest possible prices, or it can have prices that are high enough to support small businesses, but it cannot have both. Since America is a large, diverse nation we will never have agreement about what our priorities should be, but we should keep in mind, we did some real damage to ourselves during the decades that we eliminated inflation and we are gifting ourselves some real benefits during this current era of inflation.","time":1717336926,"type":"comment"},"40554202":{"by":"Jensson","id":40554202,"kids":[40554665],"parent":40554135,"text":"You don&#x27;t have higher level management?

The simple truth of the matter is that the DB server codebases are awful, complicated, places to develop this kind of functionality. I strongly believe these features should be handled at higher layers.<p>At my last job, in fintech, we used application-level shard routing with each aggregate root served by a particular RPC service (users, accounts, transactions, etc). When one of these aggregate services were asked to pull data, they would query a central routing service for the server and shard the requested data resided in.<p>Between them and the DB servers we had a cluster of pgbouncer instances to handle connection oversubscription and the routing of queries around DB instances in the face of failures or maintenance.<p>While this was pretty effective, the work to manage sharded Postgres, DDL updates, caching, locating, and balancing data was still very complicated and error prone, and was the root of many production outages.<p>I didn&#x27;t design this system, but after a couple years leading a platform migration, which necessitated getting into all this at a deep level, I would do it differently. Instead of query routing and DB sharding, I would shard the aggregate root services themselves. Each &quot;sharded&quot; set of these instances would have a simple PG instance (with replica chain) behind it that knows nothing about any other set.<p>At this point, instead of routing being done by the aggregate root services locating and querying data from DB shards on huge vertically-scaled servers, each set only pulls data from their dedicated DB. A routing facade is placed in front of the set of sets that sends requests from consumers to the one holding the desired data.<p>With this architecture, the complexity of sharding and vertically scaling at the DB layer, and handling connection oversubscription with a query router like PGbouncer, just falls away.<p>I would keep these sets, and their DBs, rather small to also reap the benefits of small datasets. One of the biggest issues we had with huge DBs is the time it takes to do anything; as an example, restarting replication in a failed chain could take many hours because of the huge amount of data, and any hiccups in connectivity would quickly overrun our capability to &quot;catch&quot; replication up and we&#x27;d have to fall back to zfs-send to resnap.<p>A larger number of smaller DBs would not improve the total time needed to do something like backups or DDL mutations, but it would significantly reduce the time for any particular instance which reduces overall risk and blast radius of a DB failure.<p>Another thing I think small DBs can help with is data locality, DB automation, and possibly making the instances effectively ephemeral. When your dataset is small, bringing an instance up from a hot backup can take on the order of a few seconds, and could allow you to schedule the root services and their DB on the same host.<p>For geographical distribution, the routing facade can also send writes to the set serving that shard in some other region.","time":1717337006,"type":"comment"},"40554217":{"by":"nakedneuron","id":40554217,"kids":[40554255,40554573],"parent":40551725,"text":"Has anybody made the same observation? :<p>Philosophy seems to be concerned with furniture a lot.

It envisaged the separation of the monetary and credit functions of the banking system, by requiring 100% reserve backing for deposits. Irving Fisher (1936) claimed the following advantages for this plan:<p>(1) Much better control of a major source of business cycle fluctuations, sudden increases and contractions of bank credit and of the supply of bank-created money.<p>(2) Complete elimination of bank runs.<p>(3) Dramatic reduction of the (net) public debt.<p>(4) Dramatic reduction of private debt, as money creation no longer requires simultaneous debt creation.<p>We study these claims by embedding a comprehensive and carefully calibrated model of the banking system in a DSGE model of the U.S. economy.

There are massive businesses that do sell extremely high-quality products - in fact, Japan went through a transition where their businesses went from producing absolute junk (i.e. just like the stuff we import from China today) to producing extremely high quality products (see Juran, Crosby, and cost of quality measures etc...). The key point of the article is that consumers today choose low-priced products since the market gives it to them. If you allow a person to buy a $800 sofa which looks great on the outside and is made in China albeit with extremely low quality materials vs. a sofa which looks almost exactly the same but is priced at $1500 but is of much higher quality - most consumers will obviously choose the $800 dollar sofa vs the $1500 since that&#x27;s how the free-market functions. Is this rational though?<p>Well - the consumer will need to buy 4 of the $800 dollar sofas just from having to replace them throughout a 20 year period vs. having the ability to buy one (the $1500) one but that&#x27;s not obvious to the consumer and it&#x27;s not clear how to even make this type of judgment. Which sofa really costs the most to you given the information I just provided? The high-quality $1500 one or the $800 dollar one? To a rational person having all of the above information - the more costly one is cheaper - but to an average consumer not having this information the clearly cheaply made product is the better choice. People also are prone to more short-term thinking in many societies which also doesn&#x27;t help things but the takeaway in general which you posted there is very wrong: mass production and scale usually result in higher-quality products not lower quality ones.","time":1717338767,"type":"comment"},"40554485":{"by":"adastra22","id":40554485,"parent":40552794,"text":"Look up Cambridge Analytics and the Trump campaign in 2016.","time":1717338769,"type":"comment"},"40554486":{"by":"Jensson","id":40554486,"parent":40554399,"text":"&gt; No true scotsman!<p>Do you even know what that means?

Most of the problems in the furniture market today deal with a trend that middle class try to imitate the rich interior design look and feel. The uneducated consumer is surrounded by a market ----- created demand for which is furniture knockoffs of fashion furniture brands that you see in Interior Design Magazines.<p>The furniture is built with poor materials, and dangerous chemicals treating finishes and frame construction. Almost all faux finishes (veneer, marble, concrete, leather, stone etc...) is made with really bad ingredients to give it the overall look and feel to the real texture they are trying to imitate.<p>The fashion brand furniture keeps evolving as a fashion brand should even when it comes to furniture. Therefore, furniture is a trend market, where people can afford it. Where people can not afford it, they fill their space with the knockoff furniture, realize it is not good quality, accumulate enough money to repeat the cycle with another poorly manufactured replacement. This is what is driving most of the demand today to keep churning out low price-point furniture for the newly emerging middle working class of today&#x27;s world that do not understand what really goes on behind the scenes of how their furniture gets made, or maybe they don&#x27;t care.<p>The other furniture market is for people who, as others commented, leave furniture pieces to their children. Those groups do not care about fashion, as with people that just need clothes to walk around not caring about the brand that they are advertising.<p>There is still good affordable furniture out there. Hand-built with care and precision as a Rolls-Royce car would be in the factory, mostly small companies in Italy and other parts of the world still to this day make great long-lasting pieces. The locality of the furniture manufacturer matters on the price significantly.

But at the same time, when that happens, you do not get any clear error, either. <i>That</i> is the nasty part here, and it is exacerbated by the lack of any kind of static or even dynamic typing to distinguish sequences from non-sequences - e.g. Python is also a very dynamic language, and has a rich set of built-in data structures, but there&#x27;s no point at which len() will silently do the wrong thing for any of them. Either a given collection type supports it, in which case you get a meaningful value, or it doesn&#x27;t, in which case you get an error. In Lua, if you ever get an invalid table as input, you will silently get the wrong value which is nevertheless indexable, and so when you use it you get another wrong value etc, and eventually your computation just produces garbage output with no obvious clues as to where the error was introduced. That is a clear design defect in the language.<p>As far as personal experiences, I can&#x27;t speak for OP, but I&#x27;ve learned Lua in early 00s, long before Python. As languages go, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the worst dynamically typed language by far - it sure beats JavaScript, and Python could learn some things from it as well.
